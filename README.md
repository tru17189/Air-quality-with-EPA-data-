# Air-quality-with-EPA-data-

In our beautiful world, there are many resources that we must take care of. One of those is, of course, the air. As we probably know, the air is a layer of gases retained by Earth's gravity, but for sure, we know that the air is something we need to breathe. Take care of it; it's important. In order to do it, we first need to know in which state it is. Based on that, in this GitHub repository, I will explore EPA air quality data across the country.

This repository is split into different Jupyter notebooks. Each of them applies a different statistical technique, like descriptive statistics or hypothesis testing. That's why the notebooks are numbered, so I encourage you to read them in the correct order.

Every step done here is commented on and explained. Therefore, the results gotten here are easy to follow and replicate. All this was developed using Python and several Python libraries. This data was obtained from Coursera's Google Advanced Data Analytics Professional Certificate, which took the data from the United States Environmental Protection Agency page (https://www.epa.gov/outdoor-air-quality-data).
